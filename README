Create a language plugin
------------------------
To create a plugin of checks, create a file in src/reviewtools/checks.
All the files in this folder are automatically loaded.

Your class should inherit from the class `LangCheckBase`.
You may want to create a Base class for your own language. Then each tests
is a class. This class has a __init__ method with predefine information
(such as the link to the guidelines and the text to be printed) and a
run method which is what is actually performing the test.

For your test to be taken into account, the class should have
- 'Check' (case sensitive) in its name
- *Not* end with 'Base' (this is reserved for parent class which don't
actually run tests).
- The result of the test should be set using the self.set_passed():
    None            == na
    'inconclusive'  == pending
    True            == passed
    False           == failed
The file plugin.tmpl shows the basic structure/idea and implement an
example test.

External plugins
----------------
It is also possible to create plugins in different languages than
Python. See api/README for details
